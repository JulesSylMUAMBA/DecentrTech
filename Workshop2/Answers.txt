What i observed is just the torrent of Directory is a bit heavier than the torrent of just image.
And the directory partition1 no longer weigh anything anymore, but when we in there the cat image still weih the same as the beginnin.

ls -l
total 8

I observed that the main difference is on the hash of the directories.

But when we compare directertly the directory without going through torrent info , there's no differente.



IPFS
Questions


    Q1 - Upload the previous image to IPFS.
The file is there.

    Q2 - Now upload partition1 to IPFS. What do you observe compared to the torrent part?
The file and the directory have the same size


    Q3 - Copy the partition1 folder and then generate the associated torrent. What do you observe?

I've copie partition1 into partition2, and we can notice they got the same CID.
I've retrieved it, i created partition3 with partion4 in it, and inside partition4 there's the image.

I've noticed that the partiction 3 have different CID but partition4 has same CID than partition1 and 2.
The same for the cat image.
So it's Something about tree structure maybe.
